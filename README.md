# Add to Shaarli

This chrome extension lets you add the current tab or note to your [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli) instance.
It has default keyboard shortcuts: Alt+S for adding URL, Alt+N for adding Note.
I also changed icon in browser panel and added one to extension page. Just because I didn't like the previous one.

This extension doe uses URLs, so it works regardless of Shaarli API which might be useful in case you struggle with Shaarli API on shared hosting as much as I am.

### New features:
- adding notes
- keyboard shortcuts:
    - **Ctrl+S** for **adding url** 
    - **Ctrl+N** for **adding note**
- new icons

This is fork of [Original Extension](https://github.com/burgyl/AddToShaarli)
